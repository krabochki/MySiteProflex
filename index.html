          It won't be an exaggeration to say that English is the most important language 
                  in the world. Nearly half of the world population speaks English. Some of the largest countries in the world are English-speaking. 
                  Among them the USA, Canada, Australia and Great Britain. <br><br> English has become an international language due to its significance 
                  in many areas, such as industry, business, finance, agriculture, and else. <br> <br>It’s the accepted language of modern digital era. 
                 A lot of problems of the 21st century, such as the problems of war and peace, ecology, can not be solved without speaking the same language.
